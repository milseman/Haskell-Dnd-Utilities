Execute by running from this top-most directory. e.g. "ghci Dnd/Dice/DiceInterpreter.hs"

Required packages:
  Data.List.Utils (provided in "missingh")
  System.Console.Readline (provided in haskell readline package, see below for Arch)

For Arch users:
  GHC is unable to properly understand linker scripts, so replace
  /usr/lib/ncurses.so with a symlink to the proper ncurses.so
  e.g: sudo ln -s libncurses.so.5 libncurses.so

Enter the interpreters by running the "main" function

See help by typing help in the running interpreter
